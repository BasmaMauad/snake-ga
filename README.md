# Deep Reinforcement Learning
## Project: Train a AI how to play Snake with gym env

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop an AI Bot able to learn how to play the popular game Snake from scratch. In order to do it, I implemented a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm. This approach consists in giving the system parameters related to its state, and a positive or negative reward based on its actions. No rules about the game are given, and initially the Bot has no information on what it needs to do. The goal for the system is to figure it out and elaborate a strategy to maximize the score - or the reward.

## Install
This project requires Python 3.6 with the pygame library installed,gym, as well as Keras with Tensorflow backend.

## Run
To run the game, executes in the snake-ga folder:

```python
python test.ipynb
```

This will run the agent.
